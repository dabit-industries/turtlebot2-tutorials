## 3D SLAM with RGB-D Sensors
An RGB-D sensor, like the Orbbec Astra or Microsoft Kinect, houses a color camera (RGB) along with a depth camera (D).
Using the depth sensor, we can map the color image on top of the depth image to get a 3D color image.

## RTABMAP
RTABMAP (Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping) is a RGB-D Graph-Based SLAM approach based on an incremental appearance-based global Bayesian loop closure detector.
